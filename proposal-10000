## Problem

1. Current MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course) require significant time investment from users
2. Many people have busy working/social lives and are unable to sit down to watch a few hours of lecture videos each week
3. Thus, many people are unable to make use of MOOCs or are unable to learn consistently

## Solution

### "10,000: Learning in bite-sized chunks"

1. Divide lesson content into bite sized chunks that are designed for users to access during times they wouldnt be doing anything else
  - times like: taking public transport, waiting times, eating alone, etc
  - users can decide how much they want to commit each day
  - aims for consistent learning so even though users may only learn a little bit each day, in the end it adds up

2. Use learning techniques to ensure that users are able to retain information
  - practice testing: make users answer short questions after each session
  - distributed learning: have review sessions after a specific period of time (like 24 hours, etc)
  
## Competitors

1. All the MOOC sites
2. All those "learning" apps on the Play Store/App Store
