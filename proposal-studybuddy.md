## Audience
Lonely Students

## Problems
**Students who want to study, but have no friends availible to study with.**

- no friends
- friends are busy

## Solution
**"Like tinder, but for people you want to study with."**

Two main functions:
1. Input a block of time, it will find people who are also free/down to study during that period of time
2. Input a place, it will find people who would like to study at/near that place.

## Assumptions
- People are actually willing to go and study with a random person
- There is a large enough userbase so people who would like to study can find people they would like to study with without too long of a wait.

## Unique Selling Point
Our version will succeed because it is specifically tailored for this purpose

## Competitors
Other competitors:
- meetup.com
- tinder social
- CLIQ
- squad
- skout


Differences:
- none of the apps listed above are actually for finding study buddies, its more for finding friends / people to hang out with.
